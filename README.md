# Project Euler Solutions in Python (Jupyter Notebooks)

This repository contains solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks**. Each notebook includes the problem description, a detailed explanation of the solution, and the Python implementation. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented solutions that are easy to understand and reusable.

## Motivation

I started this repository as a way to challenge myself and improve my problem-solving skills in mathematics and programming. Project Euler is a treasure trove of fascinating problems that combine mathematical theory with algorithmic thinking, and solving them has been an excellent way to:

- **Deepen my understanding of mathematics**: Most of the problems require knowledge of number theory, combinatorics, geometry, and other mathematical concepts.
- **Enhance my programming skills**: Implementing efficient algorithms in Python has helped me learn new techniques and improve my coding practices.
- **Build a portfolio**: Sharing my solutions publicly allows me to showcase my skills and contribute to the learning of others.
- **Enjoy the process**: Solving these problems is both fun and rewarding, as each solution brings a sense of accomplishment.

This repository is also a way to document my journey through the Project Euler archive, share my solutions with others who may be tackling the same problems, and help me stay accountable and motivated to keep solving problems consistently.
